# Pokemon Starter Picker

A repository that holds a very basic project that draws out images of certain Pokemon starter types according to the input of the user. The aim of this project was to solidify my understanding of calling on API's, drawing out what data I would need and manipulating the DOM using the data. Furthermore, I aimed to understand basic Javascript object syntax and foundational knowledge on promises.
